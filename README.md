# Blocks-BirthdayGame

This is a just a trial game created as a birthday gift to myself. It is my take on the popular block game that has captured the imagination and time of many since handheld video-games. The game is a desktop game to be played using arrow keys and should ideally work on all browsers. 
This repository contains all the iterations (i.e. trials & errors) that the game development process took (omg... that sounds fancy, just means coding here)
